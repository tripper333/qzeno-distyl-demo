# Q-Zeno Controller Demo: DGFT × Quasar Alpha for Distyl AI

This prototype demonstrates an adaptive field control mechanism based on **Dynamic Gradient Fields Theory (DGFT)**, inspired by the **Quasar Alpha model**, and tailored for **Distyl AI's SQL generation planning stack**.

## Features
- **Zeno μ Controller** for real-time embedding stability assessment.
- **Sketch reliability predictor** simulating the SQL planning layer.
- **Visual feedback** for field modulation and confidence guidance.
- Inspired by the structure and performance behavior of Quasar Alpha models.
